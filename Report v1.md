|---------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
|Comp'ble fac-s units, mean |    211      |    -     |    180     |     217    |

### Occupancy

|                           |   Delaney   | Comp Set |   County   |    Metro   |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
|Occupancy IL, mean         |    73.2%    |   74.0%  |    82.5%   |    83.1%   |
|Occupancy AL, mean         |     -       |   82.4%  |    71.2%   |    79.1%   |

Occupancy in IL units at both Delaney and its Comp Set are lower than in Fort Bend or Houston metro. The difference of roughly 10% is significant and warrants an inquiry into what is different in Delaney and its respective comp set. 

AL units occupancy within the Comp Set is roughly similar to county and metro. Most likely, Delaney is not far behind.

It's worth noting that Delaney is the only property in the Comp Set that is located in Richmond, TX. The other 9 are in Katy, TX, spread evenly between Fort Bend and Harris counties. None have NC beds, all but two have MC units.

Reading reviews on Caring.com suggests that people don't get a great vibe from the management and non-sales staff. Coupled with higher than average prices, could explain why IL has lower occupancy than AL. That being said, it's common for younger facilities to have lower occupancy rates. With time, barring any systemic issues, the rates should improve.
